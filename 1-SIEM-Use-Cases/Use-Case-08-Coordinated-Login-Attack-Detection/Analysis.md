# Analysis Notes

## Detection Logic
A coordinated login attack often involves several different IP addresses targeting the same login endpoint within a short period. 
The SPL query identifies this behavior by calculating:
- the distinct count of client IPs per URI
- the total number of attempts

This helps detect distributed brute-force attempts or botnet-style probing.

## Automation Logic
Instead of only generating an alert, the system automatically logs the details to /var/log/alerts.log through a custom script. 
This demonstrates the ability to extend Splunk alerts with custom actions, similar to lightweight SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response).

## Testing
Simulated traffic was generated by making repeated requests from multiple IPs to the same URI path.  
The alert successfully:
- matched the thresholds  
- triggered according to schedule  
- executed the custom script  
- wrote entries to /var/log/alerts.log  

This confirms both the detection and automation components were functioning correctly.
