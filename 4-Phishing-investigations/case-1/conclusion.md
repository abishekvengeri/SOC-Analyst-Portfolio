# Conclusion

The investigation confirms that delhoseoca.net was used as part of a phishing operation.

Key indicators include:
- Newly registered domain
- Same-day SSL certificate issuance
- Hosting on cloud infrastructure
- Rapid suspension and DNS removal
- Classification as phishing by third-party intelligence sources

The infrastructure characteristics strongly suggest a short-lived phishing campaign
designed to harvest credentials before being taken down.

This case demonstrates the importance of analyzing phishing threats beyond basic
URL reputation checks by investigating domain lifecycle, hosting infrastructure,
and historical DNS data.
