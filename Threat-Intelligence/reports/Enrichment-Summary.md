# Threat Intelligence – Enrichment Summary Report  
### Prepared by: [Your Name]  
### Purpose: Review and summarize all enriched IOCs found in the dataset

---

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the threat intelligence enrichment results generated from the IOC enrichment tool.  
The goal is to understand which indicators are harmless, which may be suspicious, and which ones could require deeper investigation.

The enrichment sources referenced include:
- ipinfo.io  
- VirusTotal  
- AlienVault OTX  
- AbuseIPDB  

This document presents everything in a simple, human-readable way, just like a SOC analyst would explain findings to a colleague or manager.

## 2. Summary of IOCs Reviewed

Right now, the uploaded enrichment file only included one IOC: **8.8.8.8**.  
Additional IOCs will appear here once their JSON files are uploaded.

Here’s the current table:

| IOC | Type | Risk Level | Summary |
|-----|------|------------|----------|
| **8.8.8.8** | IP Address | **Low / Benign** | Google DNS resolver, widely used and trusted |

## 3. Detailed IOC Notes

### 🔹 IOC: **8.8.8.8**  
**Type:** IP Address  
**Category:** Benign  
**Description:** This IP belongs to Google and is used as a public DNS resolver.

**What the enrichment revealed:**
- **ipinfo** confirms ownership: Google LLC  
- **VirusTotal** shows it as harmless (0 malicious engines)  
- **OTX** labels it as a **known false positive**, which is common for global DNS IPs  
- **AbuseIPDB** shows it as **whitelisted**, meaning it's globally trusted  

**Human explanation:**  
This is one of the safest and most commonly seen IPs on the internet.  
If this shows up in an alert, it’s usually noise or a misconfiguration rather than a real threat.

**SOC Action:**  
No action needed. Add to suppression list if it frequently triggers alerts.

## 4. Current Overall Threat Level

Since only one known benign IOC was included in the uploaded enrichment results, the overall risk at this stage is:

### 🟢 **Low Risk / No Threat Detected**

This section will be updated once additional IOCs are analyzed.  
(For example: suspicious IPs, malware hashes, and malicious domains.)

## 5. How This Report Is Used

This report is meant to:
- Give analysts a quick way to understand IOC severity  
- Help decide whether escalation is needed  
- Support SOC alert tuning and threat hunting  
It also serves as documentation for your SOC Analyst portfolio.
