Logon Failure Notes

• All the failed logins came from the local machine (IP: 127.0.0.1), so nothing was coming from outside the network.

• The TargetUserName in the logs is just "-" which means the system didn’t recognize the username. Looks like someone typed a wrong or invalid username.

• Status code 0xC000006D basically means “bad username or password”.  
  SubStatus 0xC0000380 suggests the username doesn’t exist.

• LogonType is 2 → this means the login attempt happened physically at the computer (interactive login), not RDP or network login.

• The process used was svchost.exe, which is normal for Windows authentication.

• From the timestamps, there were multiple failed attempts within a short time. Looks like someone repeatedly typing the wrong username.

• No successful login after the failures in this dataset.

Overall thought:
This doesn’t look like an external attack. It seems like someone at the computer typed the wrong username several times or something misconfigured tried to authenticate. Risk seems low.
