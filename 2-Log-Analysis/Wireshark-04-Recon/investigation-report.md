# Investigation Report: Reconnaissance / Scan Traffic Analysis

## Executive Summary
This investigation analyzed network traffic generated during a reconnaissance activity in an isolated lab environment. Packet-level analysis confirms the presence of a TCP SYN scan originating from a Kali Linux host targeting a Windows 10 system. The activity successfully identified open services on the target host, demonstrating early-stage attack reconnaissance behavior.

---

## Scope
- Protocol: TCP
- Attacker IP: 192.168.56.102
- Victim IP: 192.168.56.101
- Capture Environment: Isolated Host-Only virtual network
- Scan Type: TCP SYN (half-open) scan

---

## Methodology
- Network traffic was captured using Wireshark on the victim host.
- Display filters were applied to identify TCP SYN probes and SYN-ACK responses.
- Packet flags, port usage, and handshake behavior were analyzed.
- Evidence was correlated using frame numbers and TCP flags.

## Timeline of Events

| Frame | Time (UTC) | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 3 | 06:00:50.086903 | Attacker → Victim | TCP SYN probe to port 587 |
| 2046 | 06:05:08.511383 | Victim → Attacker | TCP SYN-ACK from port 135 |

## Packet Analysis Findings

### 1. SYN Probe Packet (Frame 3)
- Source IP: 192.168.56.102
- Destination IP: 192.168.56.101
- Source Port: 54551 (ephemeral)
- Destination Port: 587
- TCP Flags: SYN
- Payload Length: 0

**Analysis:**  
This packet represents a TCP SYN probe generated by an Nmap SYN scan. The absence of ACK and payload confirms that the connection was not intended to be fully established, consistent with reconnaissance behavior.

---

### 2. SYN-ACK Response Packet (Frame 2046)
- Source IP: 192.168.56.101
- Destination IP: 192.168.56.102
- Source Port: 135
- Destination Port: 53997
- TCP Flags: SYN, ACK
- Payload Length: 0

**Analysis:**  
This SYN-ACK response indicates that TCP port 135 is open and listening on the victim host. The scanner intentionally did not complete the handshake, leaving the connection half-open.

## Indicators of Reconnaissance Activity

| Indicator | Observation |
|----------|------------|
| SYN-only probes | Present |
| SYN-ACK responses | Present |
| Open port discovery | Confirmed (TCP/135) |
| Incomplete TCP handshakes | Present |
| Rapid probing behavior | Observed |

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique ID | Technique Name |
|-------------|----------------|
| T1046 | Network Service Scanning |
| T1595 | Active Scanning |

---

## Impact Assessment
Reconnaissance activity enables attackers to enumerate exposed services and identify potential attack vectors. Discovery of services such as RPC (TCP/135) may lead to further exploitation or lateral movement.

---

## Conclusion
The captured traffic demonstrates clear indicators of TCP SYN scanning. The attacker successfully identified an open service on the target host without completing TCP handshakes, confirming reconnaissance behavior consistent with early-stage attack activity.

---

## Recommendations
- Alert on high volumes of SYN-only packets
- Detect incomplete TCP handshakes
- Monitor sequential port probing behavior
- Implement IDS/IPS rules for scan detection
