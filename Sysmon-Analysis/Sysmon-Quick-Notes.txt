Sysmon Quick Notes

• Host: DESKTOP-0S2K0MN
• Source of data: sysmon-activity.csv (processed from exported Sysmon EVTX)

Observed events (generated during lab):
- Several Process Create events (we launched notepad, calc, mspaint).
- Outbound network activity from PowerShell / curl to external sites (e.g., google/microsoft) — normal test traffic.
- File create event for: C:\Users\Public\sysmon_test.txt
- Registry key added under HKCU\Software\TestKey (test value added).
- Encoded PowerShell was executed (an encoded command was observed in logs; produced an error or printed TestData depending on command used).

Interpretation:
- Activities match the safe lab actions we ran (interactive process starts, harmless network calls, file create, registry write, encoded PowerShell test).
- No signs of persistence or lateral network movement in this dataset.
- Risk = Low for this lab dataset. All activity is consistent with controlled testing.

Next steps (simple):
1. Export a subset of events showing ProcessName + CommandLine + TimeCreated for inclusion in the report.
2. Keep monitoring for any repeated suspicious patterns in real environment.
