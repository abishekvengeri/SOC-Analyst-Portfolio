# IR Case 01 – SSH Brute-Force Detection Using Wazuh

This case study demonstrates how Wazuh detects, classifies, and maps brute-force SSH attacks carried out against a Linux server. The goal of this lab was to validate Wazuh’s ability to identify repeated authentication failures, correlate them with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and escalate alert severity based on behavior.

The attack was simulated from a Kali Linux machine against an Ubuntu Server running the Wazuh agent. This mirrors a realistic credential-based attack that SOC teams must detect and investigate.
